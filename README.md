# ADB Cheatsheet

Welcome to my **ADB Cheatsheet**! This repository serves as a personal collection of Android Debug Bridge (ADB) commands that I frequently use. I decided to share it since there are very few comprehensive ADB wikis out there. Hopefully, you'll find this cheatsheet helpful for managing your Android devices via ADB.

**This page is far from complete** – I update it daily, so feel free to check back for more commands and tips!

## Introduction

**ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** is a versatile tool that lets you communicate with Android devices from a computer. It's commonly used by developers and testers for debugging apps, accessing device features, transferring files, and more.

This cheatsheet focuses on ADB commands that you can run directly from your terminal or command line, avoiding the use of `adb shell` for simplicity. However, if you prefer to work within an ADB shell, simply prefix your commands with `adb shell`.

## Getting Started

To get started with ADB, make sure that:
1. ADB is installed on your system. You can install it as part of the Android SDK or via other package managers.
2. USB Debugging is enabled on your Android device under **Developer Options**.

### Start and Stop ADB Server
```bash
adb start-server  # Start ADB server
adb stop-server   # Stop ADB server
adb kill-server   # Kill ADB server
```

### Connect to a Device via Wi-Fi
```bash
adb tcpip <port>
adb connect <device_ip>
```

### List Connected Devices
```bash
adb devices
```

## Basic Commands

Here are some essential ADB commands for managing devices:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `adb reboot` | Reboot the device |
| `adb reboot recovery` | Reboot into recovery mode |
| `adb reboot bootloader` | Reboot into bootloader mode |
| `adb install <apk_file>` | Install an APK on the device |
| `adb uninstall <package_name>` | Uninstall an app from the device |
| `adb pull <source> <destination>` | Pull a file or directory from the device |
| `adb push <source> <destination>` | Push a file or directory to the device |

## ADB Package Manager

Manage apps on your Android device using the package manager (PM):

- **List Installed Packages:**
  ```bash
  pm list packages
  ```

- **Uninstall a Package:**
  ```bash
  pm uninstall --user 0 com.package.name
  ```

- **Grant/Revoke Permissions:**
  ```bash
  pm grant com.package android.permission.READ_LOGS
  pm revoke com.package android.permission.READ_LOGS
  ```

- **Clear Application Data:**
  ```bash
  pm clear <package_name>
  ```

---

## Logcat

Logcat helps you view logs generated by the Android system, apps, and services.

- **View Logs:**
  ```bash
  adb logcat
  ```

- **Filter Logs by Priority:**
  ```bash
  adb logcat *:E  # Show only error messages
  ```

- **Clear Log Buffer:**
  ```bash
  adb logcat -c
  ```

- **Save Logs to a File:**
  ```bash
  adb logcat -f <filename>
  ```

## Dumpsys

`dumpsys` is a powerful tool to dump system information about services, apps, and hardware on your device.

- **List All Active Services:**
  ```bash
  adb shell dumpsys -l
  ```

- **Show Bluetooth Information:**
  ```bash
  adb shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager
  ```

- **Check Battery Stats:**
  ```bash
  adb shell dumpsys batterystats
  ```

---

## Dumpstate

`dumpstate` collects system logs and diagnostic data. You can use it to retrieve detailed information about the device state.

- **Dump General Device Information:**
  ```bash
  adb shell dumpstate -v
  ```

---

## AM (Activity Manager)

Activity Manager (`am`) commands allow you to control various aspects of Android apps, such as launching activities, broadcasting intents, and more.

- **Open Device Settings:**
  ```bash
  am start -n com.android.settings/.Settings
  ```

- **Factory Reset Device:**
  ```bash
  am broadcast -a android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR
  ```

---

## IMEI Commands

Here are some commands to retrieve the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) of your device:

- **Print IMEI:**
  ```bash
  service call iphonesubinfo 1 | cut -d "'" -f2
  ```

---

## Miscellaneous

These commands include a variety of useful operations such as sending SMS, waking apps, and more:

- **Send an SMS:**
  ```bash
  am broadcast -a com.whereismywifeserver.intent.TEST --es sms_body "Test message from ADB"
  ```

- **Simulate App Wake:**
  ```bash
  am set-inactive <package_name> false
  ```
